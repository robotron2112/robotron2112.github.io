<p>First things first, that's not me pictured. That's my dog, Bronson. He's cool so I figured you'd like to see a picture of him. Now that the important stuff is out of the way, I guess I can tell you that I am 32 years old and work as a broadcast engineer at WarnerMedia. I took this coding bootcamp to begin learning how code and hopefully be able to build some websites with time and practice.</p>
